When u typically use React w/o any framework like Next.js ,  the entire bundle gets delivered to the user whenever they come to the website.

This is ok with small websites but as app gets bigger it slows down

JS code initially can take a long time to load on a browser

When the browser is pulling in the javascript that needs to be on the screen we see a spinner or loading,but this is not good user experience; user wants to come on website and boom everything is working

This is where Server Side Rendering using next js comes to play
When a user visits a web page that individual page is going to be built as next js has page splitting by default

So that one page is gonna pre-built on a really fast server like Vercel
This great server has high speed internet,fast cpu and has job to pre-built a page whereas a browser is not that fast

This is results in faster page load, time to interact with page is less and much better UX as user will come to that page and immediately see it working;no loading thing

This also results in better SEO performance as when google web crawlers come to our page , instead of seeing a loading state they see an entire page at once(although they can support PWAs and can wait for sometime but here,score is obvioulsy better )

Everytime user requests for this page,it's pre-built on server
